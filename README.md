## Project Overview

This coding project demonstrates the implementation of machine learning classification using decision trees and k-nearest neighbors algorithms. 
The project focuses on classifying the species of the Iris plant based on its features. It includes data loading, model training, accuracy testing, 
visualization, and result analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features and Functionalities

- Implementation of a decision tree classifier to classify Iris plant species based on features.
- Training the decision tree model and testing its accuracy using the Iris dataset.
- Visualizing the decision tree model using a tree plot.
- Discussion and analysis of the decision tree model's performance.
- Implementation of a k-nearest neighbors classifier to classify Iris plant species based on features.
- Training the k-nearest neighbors model and testing its accuracy using the Iris dataset.
- Visualizing the decision boundaries of the k-nearest neighbors model using contour plots.
- Discussion and analysis of the k-nearest neighbors model's performance.
